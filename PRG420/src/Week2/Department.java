//Modifiers are keywords that you add to those definitions to change their meanings. The Java language has a wide variety of modifiers, including the following:
//Java Access Modifiers
//Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels are:
//Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.
//Visible to the class only (private).
//Visible to the world (public).
//Visible to the package and all subclasses (protected).

//Non Access Modifiers
//Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality.
//The static modifier for creating class methods and variables
//The final modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.
//The abstract modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.
//The synchronized and volatile modifiers, which are used for threads.

public class Department 
{
//   private boolean myFlag;
//   static final double weeks = 9.5;
//   protected static final int BOXWIDTH = 42;   
   
   // salary  variable is a private static variable
   public static double salary;

   // DEPARTMENT is a constant
   public static final String DEPARTMENT = "PRG 420 ";
}
